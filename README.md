# Cyber-Garden
My institute organize hackaton two times in year, its called Cyber Garden. 
Previously experts score projects manually, now need doing this in mobile application.
Frankly speaking, i don't know what tell about developing this app. 
- But i'm interesting how i can write app faster.
In my study project i wanna try use SnapKit, IQKeyboardManagerSwift & Lottie.
