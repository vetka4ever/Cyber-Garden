# Cyber-Garden
My institute organize hackaton two times in year, its called Cyber Garden. Previously experts score projects manually, now need doing this in mobile application. Frankly speaking, i don't know what tell about developing this app. 
But i'm interesting how i can write app faster.
In my study project i've been using SnapKit, IQKeyboardManagerSwift & wanna try Lottie.
